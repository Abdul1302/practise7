                  For some time after the introduction of word processors,
                  attempts were made to “legitimize” them by getting them
                  to mimic the look of a typewriter. Half-inch tabs and 
                  indents are a legacy of this and sadly, both the Chicago
                  Manual of Style (CMOS) and the Modern Language Association
                  (MLA) still specify half-inch paragraph indents in their 
                  style guides for manuscripts. It’s a recipe for ugly 
                  academic papers that ignores basic, long-standing principles
                                       of book design.
